v0.0.1

Added:
- Reverse chronological order sort for Simple article

Known issues:
- Need to refactor the types because the json structure is the same for all drupal json
  field_simple_article_body is not an attribute of drupal attribute
  I should make another class that inherits from drupal attribute
  call it something like drupal simple article attribute which has this property
